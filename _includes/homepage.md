### BigStash developers resources
[BigStash](https://www.bigstash.co) is a cloud-based archiving service. It's 
built on top of AWS Glacier and AWS S3, but hides the technical and billing 
complexities of these services behind an easy to use interface and simple 
pricing based on storage used.

In addition, BigStash supports copying files from and to other services 
(like Dropbox and AWS S3) on the server side.
